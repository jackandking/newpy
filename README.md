newpy
=====

Quickly python programming for small utilities. It will also enable experieced developers of other script languages to start pythoning in short time without googling. Personally I will use it recall python key syntax when I have stopped pythoning for a while.

Usage
-----
    python newpy.py -h

Samples
-------
generate test.py without samples.

    python newpy.py test

list all existing samples

    python newpy.py -l

generate test.py with sample 1 included only.

    python newpy.py test -s1

generate test.py with sample 1 and 3 included as comment.

    python newpy.py test -s13 -c

generate test.py and submit statistical data to newpy database. A global newpy ID will be assigned to your test.py. Your IP address, Author name and Sample Selection will be recorded with -r. Those data will only be used to improve newpy.
